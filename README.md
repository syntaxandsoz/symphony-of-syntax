**Symphony of Syntax** is not just a tool; it's a bridge between the cold world of logic and the rhythmic heartbeat of human expression. It takes your source code and translates it into a structured, minimalist percussion sequence.

## 🎻 The Concept

Most people see code as a set of instructions. At **Syntax & Soz**, we see it as a composition. 

By mapping programming keywords, letters, and symbols to specific frequencies—using deep **Duff (Perception Thumps)** for logic and light **Snaps (Clicks)** for syntax—this engine creates a unique "Soundtrack" for every script you write.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Halal Rhythm Engine:** No synthesized instruments or complex melodies. Just pure, rhythmic percussion (Duff and Snaps).
* **Syntax Mapping:** * `Keywords & Letters` → Deep, resonant Thumps.
    * `Symbols & Brackets` → High-frequency Snaps.
    * `Structural Indentation` → Natural Rhythmic Pauses.
* **Privacy First:** All audio processing happens locally in your browser. Your code never leaves your machine.
* **Live Visualizer:** A real-time frequency bar that reacts to your code's execution.

## 🚀 How to Experience it

1.  Visit the [Live Symphony](https://syntaxandsoz.github.io/symphony-of-syntax/)
2.  Paste your favorite script (Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.).
3.  Click **"Play Rhythm"**.
4.  Close your eyes and listen to the pulse of your logic.

## 🛠️ Built With

* **Web Audio API:** For real-time sound synthesis (no external audio files used).
* **Canvas API:** For the "Syntax Green" frequency visualizer.
* **Pure JavaScript:** No heavy frameworks. Just raw logic.

## 🤝 Contribution & Philosophy

This project is part of the **Syntax & Soz** ecosystem—where we explore the soul within the machine. If you have ideas to improve the rhythmic mapping or want to add new "Halal" sound profiles (like human-voice hums), feel free to open a Pull Request.
